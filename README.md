# Journal Club reveal.js presentation

Here I am trying out reveal.js as a way to produce talks for journal clubs and other academic talks. I try out various features (lists, links, nested slides, images, slide numbers and maths).

To view the slides, clone the repo and open index.html in your browser. Then, navigate using the arrows on the slides or your arrow keys. To see a slide overview, press ESC.
